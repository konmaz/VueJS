# Vue 3 + Vite

Just testing  Vue 3 and Vite to create a simple web app. Alongside this exploration, I've implemented a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. This automation ensures that my static website is automatically deployed to the repository's gh-pages branch, streamlining the development process.
